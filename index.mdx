#### **Introduction**

The Bumpups API leverages advanced video processing to convert raw video content into valuable, interactive outputs:

- **Summaries:** Automatically generate concise overviews for rapid understanding.
- **Timestamps:** Identify key moments to quickly navigate video content.
- **Interactive Querying:** Pose targeted questions and receive context-aware responses.

We are actively expanding our platform to integrate with additional sources such as Google Drive, Zoom, and more, further broadening integration possibilities.
