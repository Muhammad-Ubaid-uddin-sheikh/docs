#### **Overview**

Genie Analyst is a secure, enterprise-grade AI analytics platform that enables organizations to interact with their business data through natural language. Unlike public AI tools, Genie Analyst operates within a Private Multi-LLM architecture, ensuring that all data stays encrypted, compliant, and isolated from external environments. It empowers decision-makers to ask complex business questions — and receive validated, insight-rich answers in seconds, not months.

**Core Capabilities**

- **Natural Language Querying –** Ask business questions directly in plain English (or other

  supported languages) and receive precise analytical insights.
- **Private Multi-LLM Engine –** Combines multiple large language models within a secure

  environment for better accuracy, context, and reasoning.
- **Agent-Oriented Framework –** A network of specialized AI agents that handle data

  retrieval, processing, validation, and presentation autonomously.
- **Full Data Privacy & Compliance –** Compliant with SOC 2 Type II, TX-RAMP, and in progress toward GDPR certification. Genie never shares or trains on your data.
- **Seamless Integrations –** Connects with SAP, MongoDB, Azure SQL, Google Sheets,

  AWS, and internal data vaults through secure connectors.
- **Scalable Infrastructure –** Built on Azure Cloud with local secure vault options for hybrid or

  on-premise deployments.

#### **Architecture & Data Flow**

- **Connect to Data Sources –** Securely connects with enterprise databases, CRMs, ERPs,

  and vaults.
- **Prompt Received –** Users submit questions or analytical tasks through Genie’s

  interface.
- **Intent Understanding –** The system interprets the context and breaks down the query

  into structured analytical steps.
- **Query Generation –** Genie writes optimized SQL or API queries for the relevant database.
- **Data Retrieval & Cleaning –**  Extracted data is validated, cleaned, and normalized.
- **Multi-Source Reasoning –** Genie analyzes internal databases, searches private vaults,

  applies its own reasoning, and performs secure web lookups when needed.
- **Answer Validation –** Each response is verified through consistency checks. If the data is

  insufficient or ambiguous, Genie will never provide an incorrect answer — it instead asks

  the user for clarification.
- **Result Presentation –** Insights are displayed as dashboards, charts, or structured reports for immediate decision-making.
